### Programmatic Usage

```python
from garmin_planner import GarminActivityDownloader, GeminiWorkoutPlanner
import os

# Download activities
downloader = GarminActivityDownloader(
    email=os.getenv('GARMIN_EMAIL'),
    password=os.getenv('GARMIN_PASSWORD'),
    output_dir="my_activities"
)

result = downloader.download_activities(weeks=2)
print(f"Downloaded {result['downloaded']}/{result['total']} activities")

# Generate workout plan
planner = GeminiWorkoutPlanner(api_key=os.getenv('GEMINI_API_KEY'))

workout_plan = planner.generate_workout_plan(
    context_file="training_context.txt",
    activities_dir="my_activities",
    weeks=1
)

saved_file = planner.save_workout_plan(workout_plan, "my_plan.md")
print(f"Plan saved to: {saved_file}")
```

## Training Context

The AI workout planner uses a `training_context.txt` file to understand your goals and preferences. If this file doesn't exist, a default template will be created automatically.

## Output Format

### Individual Activity Files

Each activity is saved as `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_TYPE_NAME_ID.json` with structure:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "activity_id": "123456789",
    "name": "Morning Run",
    "type": "running",
    "start_time": "2024-01-15T08:30:00",
    "download_timestamp": "2024-01-20T10:15:00",
    "duration": 1800,
    "distance": 5000,
    "calories": 350
  },
  "garmin_data": {
    "summary": { /* Garmin activity summary */ },
    "details": { /* Detailed metrics and data */ }
  }
}
```

### Summary File

`activities_summary.json` contains overview of all downloaded activities:

```json
{
  "download_info": {
    "total_activities": 10,
    "download_timestamp": "2024-01-20T10:15:00",
    "date_range": {

## Authentication

### Garmin Connect
The tool uses the `garth` library for Garmin Connect authentication. Session tokens are automatically saved and reused to minimize login requests.

Session files are stored in `~/.garth` and will be reused across runs.

### Google Gemini
Uses the official Google Generative AI library. Requires a valid API key from Google AI Studio.

## Error Handling

- Invalid credentials will show clear error messages
- Network issues are handled gracefully with retries
- Individual activity download failures won't stop the entire process
- AI generation errors are caught and reported clearly
- Verbose mode shows detailed error information

## Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Use environment variables in production environments
- Session tokens are stored securely in your home directory
- API keys are only used for their intended services

## Contributing

1. Install development dependencies: `make dev`
2. Format code: `make format`
3. Run linting: `make lint`
4. Run tests: `make test`
